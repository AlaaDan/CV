  <p>Aspiring <strong>Software Developer</strong> with experience in network, system administration, and <strong>AWS cloud servers</strong>.</p>
  <p>Porgramming has always been my area of interest and I enjoyed creating handy tools and games in my free time.</p>
  <p>I am a fast learner and I believe in learning by doing combined with my love for programming I believe I would become productive swiftly and easily.</p>
  <p>My professional experience includes technical and non-technical roles, which helped me gain technical competence and significantly enhanced my interpersonal skills.</p>
  <p>Fueled by a passion for IT and leading technologies therefore I started a 2 years higher school education aiming to be a <strong>Backend Developer</strong> which will be a great combination with <strong>cloud administration</strong> </p>
  <p>to reach my ultimate goal which is <strong>AWS/DevOps engineer</strong> .
